<!-- In MVC structure, the View is responsible for presenting the data to the user  -->
<!-- Thus, the HTML parts are made here in the views through the ejs extensions -->
<!-- Where EJS - Embedded JavaScript refers to template file of HTML that has EJS code  -->
<!-- templates are used to generate dynamic HTML content
     on the server-side before sending it to the client's web browser. -->
     <!-- usage --   {   <%=   %>   }       -->
